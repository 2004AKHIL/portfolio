  <h3>About</h3>
  <p>
    I am a Computer Science (AI & ML) undergraduate with hands-on experience
    in building end-to-end machine learning pipelines. My work focuses on
    imbalanced healthcare datasets, NLP-based text classification, and
    object detection systems. I have conducted comparative research on
    SMOTE variants, achieving strong minority-class performance and
    contributing to a conference-accepted publication.

  <h3>Projects</h3>

  <p>
    <b>A Comparative Study of SMOTE Variants in Healthcare ML</b><br>
    Evaluated 14 SMOTE variants with 10 ML classifiers on heart-failure datasets.
    Identified CatBoost + SMOTE as the best-performing combination
    (F1 = 0.88, ROC-AUC = 0.93). Conference-accepted research work.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Object Detection in Images</b><br>
    Built a YOLOv8-based object detection pipeline supporting real-time inference,
    confidence filtering, and annotated visualization.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>SMS Spam Filtering using NLP</b><br>
    Developed an NLP-based spam classifier achieving 96% accuracy on 5,500+ SMS messages,
    reducing false positives by 22%.
